# Hate Speech Detection in Tweets

The objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify tweets as containing hate speech or not. It uses the Davidson and Hateval datasets for training and evaluation.

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bianca-ghx/hate-speech-detection-in-tweets.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd hate-speech-detection-in-tweets
    ```
3. Install the required Python libraries

## Usage
To use the hate speech detection models, follow these instructions:

1. Open the appropriate Jupyter Notebook:
    - For Davidson dataset exploration: `data-exploration-davidson.ipynb`
    - For Hateval dataset exploration: `data-exploration-hateval.ipynb`
    - For model training and evaluation: `hate-speech-detection.ipynb`
2. Run the cells in the notebook to explore the data, preprocess it, and train the models.
